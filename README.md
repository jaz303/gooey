UI library for SDL/cairo.

Current status: unfinished & useless

Not sure what direction this is going to take.

## TODO

### Next Up

  - [x] Event capturing e.g. for handling clicks/drags
  - [x] Decide how coordinate system should work for nested views
  - [ ] Container (toolbar)
  - [ ] Layout manager for toolbar
  - [ ] Knob
  - [ ] Slider
  - [ ] Split view
  - [ ] SDL container view

This leaves: text inputs, labels, check boxes, radio buttons, floating windows, key windows

### Deferred

  - [ ] Use HW accelerated rendering (i.e. `SDL_Renderer`)
